### NTUPC_2021
# In 2021, NTUPC (National Taiwan University Programming Contest) was firstly held. Unfortunately, that was the first time I participate a programming contest, in a group method. We coudln't enter to the final, and that is quite an unfortunate. However, I gained my experience and manage to solve all of them afterward, in CPP.
